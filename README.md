## hey, i’m edita 👋

i’m a creative entrepreneur, marketing strategist & now… a coder in the making.  
i’m learning how to build tools that blend design, content, and automation — with a soft touch.

- ⚙️ building [F.fect Studio](https://yourlink.com) — a soft marketing platform powered by AI  
- 💡 automating content workflows for modern brands

### current stack:
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- Python + Flask (mini tools, content automation)  
- Webflow / Canva / Notion (always in the mix)

### goals:
- build real products that help creators do more with less  
- turn marketing into art  
- share my journey to inspire others to create their own path
